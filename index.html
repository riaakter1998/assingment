             <h3>Rani Mukhargi hobby</h3>
             <p>Mumbai: No starry tantrums or airs, Rani Mukherjee took every question that was thrown at her at the Bangalore
                Literature Festival. The actress spoke of films, life after marriage and every-thing in between. After raising
                 awareness on child-trafficking in Mardaani, Rani Mukherjee now talks about the 
                importance of women empowerment. “Mothers need to teach their sons to respect women. 
                Mindsets need to change and women must stand up and retaliate when required. That said, 
                as an actor, I feel we should do more socially relevant films, even if it doesn’t rake in the greens at the 
                box office. After all, it doesn’t hurt to do one film that goes beyond the realms of entertainment. That is the reason 
                I did Mardaani,” says the actress. <br> <br> <br>
                 
                The new bahu of the Yash Raj family says that as much as she loves the romantic movies with t
                heir typical song-dance sequences, she equally, if not more, enjoys the ones that require her to kick some rear end! 
                Speaking of marriage, the actress says that the new phase has brought along with it new hobbies.
                “I have a newfound hobby looking after my home. I never realised how difficult it was for my mother 
                until now. I am clueless when the househelp asks me what her chores for the day are,” she says.</p>
